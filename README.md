PN532 NFC Module
===================

This module uses the PN532 NFC reader/writer to interface with RFID tags on the 13.56MHz frequency (also known as NFC/Near Field Communication). It read to write to tags, as well as emulate a tag itself and store data to be read, i.e. by another reader or an NFC-enabled smartphone.

The PN532 is connected to the Arduino using a UART serial connection, and requires the included PN532 Arduino library to successfully communicate. Read the included manual for a detailed tutorial.
